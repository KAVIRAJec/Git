# Undoing Changes and Reverting Commits

## Overview
This task demonstrates how to undo changes in the working directory and safely revert or reset commits.
## Steps Performed

1. **Undo Changes using `git restore`**
  - Created a new file named `index.html` and added initial content.
  - Commit the file and added some changes.
  - Used `git restore` to undo the changes:
    ```sh
    git restore index.html
    ```
2. **Undo Changes using `git checkout`**
  - Alternatively, also used `git checkout --` to undo the changes:
    ```sh
    git checkout -- index.html
    ```
  - Verified the changes were undone using:
    ```sh
    git status
    ```

3. **Undo a Commit Using `git revert`**
  - Made a new commit named "Added changes in index.html[ADD]"
  - Reverted the last commit using:
    ```sh
    git revert HEAD
    ```
  - Verified that a new commit was created to undo the changes:
    ```sh
    git log --oneline
    ```

4. **Undo a Commit Using `git reset`**
  - Reset the repository to the previous commit:
    ```sh
    git reset --soft HEAD~1
    ```
  - Verified the commit history to see the branch pointer moved back:
    ```sh
    git log --oneline
    ```
