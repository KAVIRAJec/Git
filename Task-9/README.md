# Working with Remote Repositories and Collaboration

## Overview
This task demonstrates how to simulate a collaborative workflow using remote repositories, feature branches, and pull requests.

## Steps Performed

1. **Created a Local Repository**
   - Initialized a Git repository in the `Task-9` directory.

2. **Linked to a Remote Repository**
   - Added a remote repository on GitHub and pushed the `main` branch.

3. **Created a Feature Branch**
   - Created a `feature-branch` and made changes to `index.html`.

4. **Pushed the Feature Branch**
   - Pushed the `feature-branch` to the remote repository.

5. **Opened a Pull Request**
   - Opened a Pull Request (PR) from `feature-branch` to `main` on GitHub.
   - Simulated a code review process.

6. **Merged the Feature Branch**
   - Merged the `feature-branch` into `main` on the remote repository.

7. **Pulled Changes Locally**
   - Pulled the latest changes from the remote `main` branch to the local repository.
